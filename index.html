                <h3 class="first-h">What is a Moon? What does it do?</h3>
                <p class="first-p">The Moon is a rounded astronomical body that orbits the Earth as its only natural satellite. It has a rocky silicate composition and is of planetary mass but has no significant atmosphere, hydrosphere or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is 0.1654 g, about one-sixth of Earth's.
                <span class="what">The Moon takes 27 days to revolve around the earth. The Moon's average orbital distance from Earth is 384,402 km (238,856 mi) or 1.28 light-seconds. Its gravitational influence produces Earth's tides and slightly lengthens Earth's day.</span></p>

                <p class="port-2">The moon's surface is covered with dead volcanoes, impact craters, and lava flows, some visible to the unaided stargazer. Early scientists thought the dark stretches of the moon might be oceans. The moon's surface is mostly covered with dust called Lunar Soil, there is no air present at all. The first person to step on the moon was Neil Amstrong.
                <span class="remo">Recently NASA has found water on moon with the help of Chandrayaan 1. The water on moon NASA found was approximately 2.81 water bottles of each 1 litre. All the space research organizations are expecting more water on moon which led to them build colonies on moon for humans to move onto the surface of moon.</span>
                <h4 class="new-topic">Why is one side of the moon thicker than the other?</h4>
                <span class="answer-dude">The lunar crust possesses high concentrations of aluminum and calcium, elements that are very hard to vaporize. ... Eventually, these elements combined with silicates in the mantle of the moon to form minerals known as plagioclase feldspars, making the crust of the far side about twice as thick as that of the near side.</span></p>

                <p class="usa-dirty">It is true, the moon is drifting away from the earth. It is moving approximately 3.8 cm away from our planet every year. It is estimated that it will continue to do so for around 50 billion years.</p>&nbsp;
                <h2 class="bill">During the 1950s, the USA considered detonating a nuclear bomb on the Moon</h2>
                <p class="gates">It is true, in the era of 1950, the USA planned to detonate the moon with nuclear bomb. The secret project was during the height cold war was known as "A Study of Lunar Research Flights" or "Project A119" and meant as a show of strength at a time they were lagging behind in the space race.</p>

                <h2 class="steve">The moon is the fifth-largest natural satellite</h2>
                <p class="jobs">The moon is a fifth-largest natural satellite in our solar system. At 3,475 km in diameter, the Moon is much smaller than the major moons of Jupiter and Saturn. A prevailing theory is that the Moon was once part of the Earth, and was formed from a chunk that broke away due to a huge object colliding with Earth when it was relatively young.</p>&nbsp;
                <h2 class="walk">Only 12 people have ever walked on the Moon</h2>
                <p class="run">There are only 12 people in the history of mankind who have walked on the moon. It started with Neil Armstrong in 1969 as part of the Apollo 11 mission and ended with Gene Cernan in 1972 on the Apollo 17 mission. What is interesting to know is that all 12 people were from the USA.</p>
