# Science-Project
 my science project on moon, hopefully you will use this like a template

## How to use
1. Download it, put your information and images replacing mine.
2. The app.js is like a voice bot that speeks the `string` given to it.
3. For the SpeechSynthesis there are multiple properties, but I used small number of properties such as rate, etc. [SpeechSynthesisUtterance docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesisUtterance)
4. Customize as you want!
